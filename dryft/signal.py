"""

Removes non-linear ground reaction force signal drift in a stepwise manner. It is intended
for running ground reaction force data commonly analyzed in the field of Biomechanics. The aerial phase before and after
a given stance phase are used to tare the signal instead of assuming an overall linear trend or signal offset.

    Designed for running, hopping, or activity where 1 foot is on the force plate at a time.
    Identified stance phases are compared to min/max contact time (tc) to eliminate ones that are too short/long. 
    Update these parameters and threshold if little-no stance phases are identified. Setting plots=True can aid in

    Parameters
    ----------
    vGRF : `ndarray`
        Filtered vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) signal [n,]. Using unfiltered signal will cause unreliable results.
    threshold : `number`
        Determines when initial contact and final contact are defined. In the same units as vGRF signal. Please be
        responsible and set to < 50N for running data.
    Fs : `number`
        Sampling frequency of signal.
    min_tc : `number`
        Minimum contact time, in seconds, to consider as a real stance phase. Jogging > 0.2s
    max_tc : number
        Maximum contact time, in seconds, to consider as a real stance phase. Jogging > 0.4s
    plot : `bool`

        determining appropriate threshold, min_tc, and max_tc values.
